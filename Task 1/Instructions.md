# Task 1

### Skills to be assessed:
- Ability to use version control tool, specifically Git
- Ability to read and understand existing codebase
- Ability to contribute code to an existing codebase

### Challenge
To complete all the tasks in this test, you will be making use of this repository. For your first challenge, please clone this repository into a folder on your local computer and complete the following:

1. Create a *private repo* on [Github](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and push the contents of this repository to the private repository. Hint: See how to [manage git remotes](https://help.github.com/categories/managing-remotes/).

2. The code in the file [random-quotes.js](/Task%201/random-quotes.js) when executed, prints out a random quote from an object that contains quotes as values and number indexes as keys. You are required make some changes to the code to only print out quotes whose key is not an even number.

3. Create a branch having a name starting with the prefix `fix/` and a suffix that describes the implementation needed in two.

4. Open a pull request proposing changes from the branch created in 3 above to be merged to the master branch on your private repo created in 1. Your pull request should have a brief description of the code changes you have made.
