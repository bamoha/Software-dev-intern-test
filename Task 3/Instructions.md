# Task 3

## Skills to be assessed

- Ability to implement simple page designs using purely HTML and CSS.
- Approach to implement responsiveness in pages.

## Challenge

Develop a simple, responsive contact form using purely HTML5 and CSS3. The form should contain the following fields:

- Full Name
- Email Address
- Subject
- Message

Also, you should include a submit button that is properly positioned relative to the fields for the contact form both on a desktop screen and a mobile screen.

Please note that the form submission doesn't need to be functional (i.e. sending emails, posting to a server etc are not necessary). This test seeks only to evaluate html page responsiveness.
